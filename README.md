# Getting-to-Philosophy
The program receives a Wikipedia link as an input, go to another normal link and repeat this process until either Philosophy page is reached, or we are in an article without any outgoing Wikilinks, or stuck in a loop (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Getting_to_Philosophy).

## Prerequisites:
1. Python 3.7
2. python requests module `pip install requests`

## Usage:
`python task1-GettingtoPhilosophy.py`

Since we didn't provide a -dir argument all logs files will be saved in current directory.
